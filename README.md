<b># CRYPTO</b>
Crypto project from LaunchCode class.

<b>INFO:</b>
We worked on this project solo, with advice from fellow students and teaching fellows (and SO. MUCH. GOOGLING). It took right around two weeks (though not full time). It includes several small programs.

<b>initials.py</b>
This program can be called to return the capitalized initials of a persons name, regardless of whether it was originally capitalized. It asks for user input of a name.

<b>caesar.py</b>
This program can be called to return an encrypted message based off of a single number rotation. When calling the program, you input the rotation amount after the program name (ex: caesar.py 5). It asks for user input of the message.

<b>vigenere.py</b>
This program can be called to return an encrypted message based off of a keyword. It asks for user input of the message and the keyword.

<b>helpers.py</b>
This program is not called by the user. It is used by both <i>caesar</i> and <i>vigenere</i>.
